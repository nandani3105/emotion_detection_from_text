# emotion_detection_from_text

Emotion Detection is the task of identifying emotions expressed in textual data.Useful in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and chatbots.
This project uses Python and machine learning to classify emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral.

# Tools and Libraries

Python Libraries: NeatText (text preprocessing)
                  Scikit-learn (model training)
                  Seaborn (data visualization)
                  Joblib (model saving/loading)
                  Pandas
                  NumPy (data handling)
  
# Workflow

Data Collection - Load CSV with text and emotion labels.

Preprocessing - Clean text (lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords).

Feature Extraction - Use TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Model Training - Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM.

Evaluation - Accuracy, precision, confusion matrix.

Prediction - Enter new text and predict emotion.
